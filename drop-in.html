    <h2>What to expect?</h2>
    <p>Workouts can be adjusted in weight, intensity, and certain mechanics to scale 
      to the experience and fitness levels of any individual, be it a total fitness 
      beginner or elite competitive CrossFitter. This is the reason this program 
      gets acclaim from military personnel, professional athletes, soccer Moms, 
      Dads, and grandparents alike.</p>

    <p>All of our CrossFit Classes are coach-led and follow a planned progression 
      roughly 60 minutes in duration and follow this basic structure:
      A  coach will guide you through warming up, 
      followed by movement instruction and demonstration for the workout.
      The Coach will supervise and correct any movement performed 
      by you during the workout. Post-class fistbumps and high-fives are used to celebrate the hard work and accomplishments of all.</p>
